## Introduction

If you are reading this, it mean that WebLaunch series had come to an end. The end of WebLaunch does not necessary mean the end of your learning journey, in fact it just started. 

Throughout the WebLaunch, we had a lot of shortcoming, we assume things, we went too fast, ta (teaching assistant) are not well prepared with the topic (I am one of them), we use jargon that difficult to understand, etc, but one thing that are certain is that we have a lot of passion. We are constantly trying to improve and learn from the past mistake so that we can do it even better in the future. 

As I mention earlier, end of WebLaunch does not mean the end of your journey. You might think that you are just a business student, or others, why do you need to continue learning web development? In my personal opinion, it is not really about having a special skills so it is easier to get employed, or you learn it because you are an IT student so that you can earn a lot of money being a web developer, but it is more about self enhancement. You might be a business student, finance student, marketing student, etc, but it does not mean that you only can learn about what you specialize in. I am an computer science student does not mean that I cannot learn economics, finance, psychology, philosophy, etc on my own. Equip yourself with more skills allow you to look at things with more perspective, and this skills might also help you in the future. 

Throughout the whole workshop, we had covered topic which includes `HTML`, `CSS`, `Bulma`, `JavaScript` and `DOM`. With these knowledge, it is sufficient to create a static website. But what is a static website? A static website is basically a website that cannot do things like login, chat, etc. But how can you achieve it? 

In this guide, there will be seperated into 2 part, which is Frontend and Backend. What we had learnt so far are all within the scope of frontend. 

## Guide

### Frontend

As you had know, frontend is what you see in your website. 

#### HTML & CSS

HTML and CSS is the most basic component in making a website. HTML defined how to structure looks like, while CSS defined the style or the appearance of the website. Although we had covered these in WebLaunch, but in case if you want to do some revision or you had friend who are interested but you do not have any resources, here are some tutorial which you can go through. 

**Tutorial**

#### CSS Framework

What is CSS framework? CSS framework is a framework where it include all the CSS code that had writen by some professional so that you do not need to rewrite it by yourself. It allow you to create a website much faster than you could had been without it. 

But why do you want to use one? 

	1. Save development time hence save cost

	1. No need to reinvent the wheel (Unless for educational purpose)

	1. Save cost

	1. Chances that it will be more beautiful than you could had design yourself are very high

What are some of the example of CSS framework? 

	1. [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

	1. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

	1. [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/)

	1. [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/)

	1. Flexbox

If you are paying attention, yes, we had already covered Bulma in our third workshop. Of course there are much more CSS franework than what we had mention above. You can simply google `CSS Framework` to find out even more of them. There are a lot of them, and **IT IS OK TO NOT KNOW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM**, because you don't use all of them at the same time. Master of one framework are better than you know every single framework yet master of none.

So now you ask if you want to learn outside of Bulma, are there any tutorial for it? 

Documentation are your best tutorial! 

Documentation can be found easily in the their website itself. It will usually call `Docs` or `Documentation`. Explore these CSS framework through the documentation and find out what suit you the most. There is no best CSS framework, but rather more suitable depending on the circumstances. 

#### Static Site Generator

Writing my own website is so tired, and all I need is just a static personal website or my own blog that can be static. What can I do to solve this problem? 

Static site generator is your answer. Static site generator allow you to only write the content and choose the theme that you want to have and generate a static website for you. Usually you will write your content in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and it will generate a nice website for you. If you think the template does not do what you want to, you can create your own template and generate the static website. After that, all you need to do is only constantly update your content.

Some of the example of static site generator can be found in [this website](https://www.staticgen.com/). 

In the website, it include a lot of different static site generator and they had include the official website for each of the framework, documentation can be found in their website too. 

Notable mention will be [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), because the site that you are currently viewing right now are made by Jekyll.

#### Javascript

### Backend

Backend is the part in a web where it does all the business logic and data persistent.
